# Deployment Status - Complete ✅

## Summary
heare-auth is now fully deployed with metrics integration and proper refresh workflow.

## URLs
- **Production**: https://auth.dokku.heare.io
- **Health**: https://auth.dokku.heare.io/health

## Features Deployed
✅ API key verification endpoint
✅ Health check endpoint  
✅ S3-backed key storage
✅ Structured logging (structlog)
✅ Metrics integration (heare-stats-client)
✅ Let's Encrypt SSL/TLS
✅ CLI for key management
✅ Refresh command

## Metrics Configuration
```bash
PROTOCOL=http
DEST_HOST=stats-bridge.dokku.heare.io
DEST_PORT=443
SECRET=hunter2
```

Metrics tracked:
- `heare-auth.verify.*` - Verification requests/success/failure/duration
- `heare-auth.refresh.*` - Refresh requests/success/failure/duration
- `heare-auth.health.*` - Health check requests
- `heare-auth.keys.count` - Current key count gauge
- `heare-auth.startup.*` - Startup events
- `heare-auth.shutdown` - Shutdown events

## Refresh Workflow

### Issue with dokku run
The `dokku run` command creates a one-off container, which doesn't have access to the web server running in the main container. Therefore:

❌ `dokku run auth curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/refresh` - Won't work (new container)
❌ `dokku run auth heare-auth refresh` - Won't work (no access to main web container)

### Solution: Use dokku enter
To refresh keys after creating/deleting them:

```bash
# Enter the running container
dokku enter auth web

# Inside the container, run:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/refresh

# Or use the CLI:
heare-auth refresh

# Exit
exit
```

Alternatively, create an alias:
```bash
alias auth-refresh='dokku enter auth web bash -c "curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/refresh"'
```

## Current Status
- 1 key loaded
- Health check passing
- Metrics flowing to stats-bridge
- SSL/TLS enabled

## Next Steps for User
1. Create API keys as needed
2. To refresh after creating keys:
   ```bash
   dokku enter auth web
   heare-auth refresh
   exit
   ```
3. Monitor metrics at stats-bridge dashboard
